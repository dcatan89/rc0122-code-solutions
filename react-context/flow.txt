User is routed when they press the register button to create an account
when they register, the client sends the user info to server where
it inserts the userinfo in the database and responds with a token

when the user signs in the client sends the token to the server where it verifies the key
and grants access for the user

if the page is refreshed, depending on the expiration of the key, the user will stay signed
in due to the token

when the user signs out they are redirected to the signin/signup hash where they will need to login
again and given a new token.
